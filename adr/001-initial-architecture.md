# ADR 001: Initial Architecture Decisions

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The Flag Status Monitoring System requires reliable, automated tracking and display of U.S. flag status. The system needs to handle multiple data sources, provide real-time updates, and maintain high availability.

## Decision Drivers
* Need for reliable flag status data
* Requirement for automated updates
* Cost considerations
* Maintenance overhead
* Security requirements

## Decisions

### 1. GitHub-Based Infrastructure
**Decision**: Use GitHub as the primary platform for hosting, automation, and deployment.

**Rationale**:
- Free tier supports all required functionality
- Built-in CI/CD through GitHub Actions
- Integrated version control
- Free static site hosting through GitHub Pages
- Strong security features and access controls

### 2. Multiple Data Source Strategy
**Decision**: Implement a priority-based cascade of data sources.

**Rationale**:
- Increases system reliability
- Handles source outages gracefully
- Provides comprehensive coverage
- Enables future expansion

### 3. Static Site with Dynamic Updates
**Decision**: Use a static site with client-side updates instead of a traditional backend.

**Rationale**:
- Reduces infrastructure costs
- Simplifies deployment
- Improves reliability
- Enables CDN caching

### 4. JSON for Data Storage
**Decision**: Store flag status in JSON files within the repository.

**Rationale**:
- Simple to maintain and update
- Human-readable format
- Version controlled through Git
- Easy integration with GitHub Actions

## Consequences

### Positive
- Zero infrastructure cost
- Minimal maintenance overhead
- High reliability
- Built-in version control
- Automated deployments

### Negative
- Limited by GitHub API rate limits
- Dependent on GitHub platform
- Manual override requires Git knowledge
- Limited real-time capabilities

## Alternatives Considered

### Traditional Server Architecture
**Rejected because**:
- Higher cost
- More maintenance overhead
- Unnecessary complexity
- Less reliable than static hosting

### Database Storage
**Rejected because**:
- Overkill for simple status data
- Adds unnecessary complexity
- Requires additional infrastructure
- Increases maintenance burden

### Serverless Functions
**Rejected because**:
- Additional cost without clear benefit
- Complexity of managing cold starts
- GitHub Actions provides similar capability
- Not necessary for simple status checks

## Implementation Notes

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
1. Set up GitHub repository
2. Configure GitHub Actions
3. Implement data source integration
4. Create basic frontend

### Phase 2: Enhancements
1. Add manual override system
2. Implement monitoring
3. Add state-specific tracking
4. Enhance frontend animations
